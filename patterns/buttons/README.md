The buttons use the secondary colour and secondary font to draw in the attention of the site-goer. There are three types of buttons on the site.

- The standard buttons are used for cards on the adoption page of the site. The cards are transparent and are comprised of an image and the grey accent colours allowing the button to stand out.
- The big buttons are for main actions of the site. For example: Donate, Sign Up etc... Since both the standard and big buttons are on a light background, the hover state is uses the primary background colour.
- The banner buttons are ghost-like. They have a background colour of neutral-light with opacity and a font colour of neutral-light. They will be placed on the banner image. These buttons are for links like "Visit our Blog" or "Join our Newsletter" etc... The font colour changes to accent-a in the hover state.
