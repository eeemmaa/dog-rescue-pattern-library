    The secondary typeface is a rounded sans-serif that brings playfulness and friendliness to the dog rescue site.

colors:
  primary: |
    The primary colour is the proxima-nova of colours; it brings sophistication to the site and balances out the lighter and brighter colours chosen.

    This colour is used sparingly since it is on the darker side. Use it for h1s and h2s and button hovers.
  secondary: |
    The secondary colour brings joy and playfulness to the site.

    This colour is reserved for grabbing attention so use it for links and the background colour of buttons. It is also used as the background colour for the mark selector.
  accent: |
    The accent colours are orange, a dark grey and a lighter grey. Use the orange hue for nav link hovering, quotation citings, quotes inside paragraphs, and for the page indication for the banner. When used with quotes inside paragraphs, the font-weight should either be light or the quote shouldn't be too long in order to keep the colours balanced. The lighter grey is reserved for h3s to h6s, and the darker grey is used for lists and body copy.
  neutral: |
    The neutral colours are the background light green, the off white. They are pretty and help make the brighter and vibrant colours harmonious. The light green and off white are the background colours of the site.
